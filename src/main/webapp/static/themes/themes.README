About themes
============
OpenOLAT uses a CSS based theming mechanism. A theme is set for the entire OpenOLAT installation, users
can only choose different fon't sizes. In courses, course authors can override the installed theme
with custom CSS rules to create a course layout. This document describes how you can create a
custom theme.

The OpenOLAT layout layer is based on the YAML framework (http://www.yaml.de). It is mandatory to 
understand the YAML framework before your start writing your own theme. CSS is a very complex 
world, if you are not an expert in this field, learn CSS before you start working on an OpenOLAT 
theme.

When you have created a new high-quality theme, why not share it with the OpenOLAT community?
Please contact us via the developer mailinglist (http://www.openolat.org)

Theme structure
===============
The OpenOLAT themes follow the YAML terminology, but to not create conflicts with other YAML based
CSS we use a "b_" prefix before all YAML classes. 
We also rely heavily on SASS: 
	"Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. 
	It’s translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin." 
	(http://sass-lang.com/).


In the default theme ("openolat"), the SASS (css) rules are splitted up in different files.
After compilation, all scss files are combined within one css-file called "layout.css". This file contains the whole
Stylesheet and is the only css-file included in OpenOLAT's html markup. 
( Exception: patches.scss which is compiled to patches.css and contains IE fixes)


Sass-Files:
-----------

- all/_definitions.scss 
Here you define some basic SASS variables.

- all/_mixins.scss 
Our little helpers :)  . Useful mixins.

 - all/_basemod.scss 
Basic layout. Here you define the
page background, page with and height, the elements top nav, nav using the sliding door technique, 
main with col1, col2 and col3 and the footer. We added some elements to the YAML framework in this 
area, they are also in this file.

- all/_dd.scss
DRAG and DROP style rules

- all/_dialogs.scss
Style rules for dialogs, modal windows and wizards

- all/_icons.scss
Icons, Icons, Icons

- all/_portlets_boxes.scss
Style rules for portal, portlets and toolboxes

- all/_tabpane.scss
Style rules for tabbed panes and segmented views

- all/_content.scss 
Headings, Links, Buttons, Tables, Tabs, etc.


The media files are stored in the images and the sounds directory. The images are furthermore splitted 
up in "category"-folders. Images are referenced from within the CSS files using relative url parameters.


Creating a custom theme
=======================

A good way is to start with a copy of "openolatexample" (i.e. my_theme). Adjust the variables in 
_definitions.scss according to your needs.

If you want to change the layout of	standard OpenOLAT elements lookup the css rules in the corresponding
modules in the OpenOLAT theme: from openolat/all/modules

You can a) copy the files you your theme and modify it or b) import the styles from the openolat theme
and override the values you want to change. Variant b) is recommended since it automatically adds new 
layout features from future releases. 

The structure of the scss-files is very clear, so it should be no problem to do any change and understanding
theme. If you copied a file from openolat-theme to my_theme/all, you have to adjust your layout.scss:
...
@import "all/basemod";
...
@import "all/tables";
...
@import "all/portlets_boxes";

If you want to display a logo or background-image in the #header, you should set $enablebiz to true and 
adjust the box-size to your needs.

Edit _basemod.scss (an example):
...
#b_header {
...	
@if $enablebiz == true { height: 120px; }
...
background: transparent url('images/my_logo.png') no-repeat 42px 10px;

After all work is done, you have to compile the theme (see below): sh compiletheme.sh my_theme


Testing a custom theme
======================
Once you have created the new theme you can log in as administrator and select the 
Administration site in the main navigation. Choose 'layout' from the menu. You new theme
will appear in the themes list. Select your theme to apply it. 

Note that the theme will be applied to the whole OpenOLAT installation. All users that log into
the system will work with the selected right away.


Using Sass
==========
installing on a Fedora-like-System
ensure, that "/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo" includes "Everything"
yum install ruby
yum install ruby-devel
yum install rubygem-rake
gem install sass

Compiling a theme
=================
sh compiletheme.sh [theme-folder]
or using the command-line sass --style [compressed|compact|nested|expanded] --update [theme-folder]/layout.scss:[theme-folder]/layout.css --load-path openolat openolat/all openolat/all/modules openolat/print openolat/mobile
Note: if you made changes to a .scss other than _definitions.scss i.e. content.scss, those changes are not recognized by sass. So you have to make a change to _definitions.scss for compiling the theme.
